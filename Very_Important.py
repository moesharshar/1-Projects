Differencies between versions of Libraries:-

1-from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer (instead of) from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer

2-from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split (instead of) sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split


Alternatives:-


Installations:-
1-I use Pycharm program with Python_version_3.8 wiht up-to-date libraries.
2-Can use Pycharm with miniconda enviroment.
3-Use Spyder with Python_version_3.7 as Tensorflow can't run on Python 3.8, and also Machine_Learning A-Z course 
	that uses old libraries that have differencies with new ones(mentioned above in Differencies), So i have installed 
	these libraries	on miniconda with Python_version_3.7 , specifically Scikit-learn_version_19.2 
4-in case of needing Anaconda, use Anaconda_Windos_x86_64_exe Release 5.3.1 which include scikit_learn 19.2
